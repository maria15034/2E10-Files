# 2E10-Files
A collection of the files used in 2E10 Design labs while working on the buggy project or separate assigned problems.

The main project: to design an autonomous buggy that can operate wirelessly. 
We were given an Arduino Nano 33 IoT, 2 DC motors to drive the wheels and some other components like ultrasonic and IR sensors, breadboards, wires, wheels etc.

The buggy is going to operate using sensors to detect its surroundings, and a control system to analyse the data this generates. 
It will pass several challenges, such as traversing a track without crashing into obstacles; 
following an object smoothly at a comfortable, safe distance; 
and finally, using its onboard IMU it is going to be able to report acceleration and orientation data.

The buggy will report all of the data wirelessly, using Bluetooth.
